        <h2>Labs 1 & 2 Reflection</h2>
        <i>Published on September 15th, 2024 By The Student</i>
        <p>Coming into this class I had previously completed the basic HTML5 course on W3Schools in a highschool class.
            It seems that I've retained quite a bit of knowledge from that class and it's really helped me get a leg up on these labs.
            Going into lab 2 I already knew how the structural/semantic elements required of the lab operated and how to weave them into my code with ease.
            Although I've gone into both Labs 1 & 2 with confidence in my prior knolwedge of HTML5 there has been a lot things I've picked up on since the 
            start of the class that I didn't practice or know from my last teacher.

        <h2>Lab 3 Reflection</h2>
        <i>Published on September 22nd, 2024 By The Student</i>
        <p>This weeks lab was different from the others in that we used C.S.S. which stands for Cascading Styles Sheets. We use C.S.S. as an efficient
                method to style and organize our HTML documents. I had no prior experience in C.S.S. but once you got into it and understood what very little 
                was different from HTML it became pretty easy to pick up. There were no brackets or syntax it was all using selectors, properties, and values.
                I enjoyed this weeks lab as we dove into something new and something I definitley see myself using outside of class in the real world or job world from time
                to time.
