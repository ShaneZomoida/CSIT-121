        <h2>Labs 1 & 2 Reflection</h2>
        <i>Published on September 15th, 2024 By The Student</i>
        <p>Coming into this class I had previously completed the basic HTML5 course on W3Schools in a highschool class.
            It seems that I've retained quite a bit of knowledge from that class and it's really helped me get a leg up on these labs.
            Going into lab 2 I already knew how the structural/semantic elements required of the lab operated and how to weave them into my code with ease.
            Although I've gone into both Labs 1 & 2 with confidence in my prior knolwedge of HTML5 there has been a lot things I've picked up on since the 
            start of the class that I didn't practice or know from my last teacher.
