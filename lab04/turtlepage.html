            <p>This big turtle is a resident of our local National Aquarium in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore City.<br>
                I don't know if he actually has a name, but Shelldon fits better anyway's. I picked Shelldon purely<br>
                because when I was looking for pictures it was looking right back at me and I thought it was funny.<br> 
                Anyways Shelldon was actually really cool and surprisingly fast for a turtle.</p>
