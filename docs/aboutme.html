            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Shane Zomoida, I'm Maryland born and raised. My family and I bleed orange and purple sports wise. 
                I just transfered back from a college in Florida and I'm really trying to just figure out what comes next right now.
                I'm a little antisocial, but I don't bite.

            <p>
                
                At my last college I studied Aerospace Engineering and that well... didn't stick. 
                So now I'm trying out CSIT with no general focus as of right now. I think I can
                finally say that I've found a possible career path for me.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                I play video games a lot. Outside of that I often play sports such as yard soccer and football.
                I'm  music dependent and just enjoy to be listening to anything with a catchy beat whenever I can.
                While I was in Florida I picked up surfing (not well), but i got the "surf" part, just not the "ing".
